#Wildlife Insight: Data Transformation and Model Preparation

This repository contains the code for preparing and transforming data for machine learning modeling. It involves data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the dataset is model-ready.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Clean the Data**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Transform Data**: Convert categorical variables to numerical ones and scale numerical features.
- **Prepare the Data for Modeling**: This includes encoding the target variable and normalizing the features for better model performance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **speciesName**: The name of the species.
- **systems**: Ecological system to which the species belongs.
- **scopes**: Scope of the ecological context.
- **Category**: The risk category of the species (e.g., "Endangered", "Lower Risk").

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - **Numerical Columns**: Missing values are filled with the median of the respective columns.
   - **Categorical Columns**: Missing values are filled using the mode (most frequent value).

2. **Outlier Detection and Handling**:
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is used to detect and cap outliers for numerical columns. Outliers are capped at the lower and upper bounds calculated using the IQR method.

3. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Label Encoding**: Applied to the `Category` column to convert categorical labels into numerical format.
   - **Standard Scaling**: Applied to numerical features to standardize the range of values, ensuring better performance during model training.

## Code Walkthrough

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Missing values are handled using **median imputation** for numerical data and **mode imputation** for categorical data.
   
2. **Outlier Detection and Handling**:
   - The **IQR method** is used to detect outliers, which are then capped to ensure they don't distort model training.

3. **Feature Transformation**:
   - **Label Encoding** is used to transform the target variable (`Category`) into numerical format.
   - **StandardScaler** from scikit-learn is used to scale numerical features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
